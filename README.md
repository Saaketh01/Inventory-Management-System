## Inventory Management System 
Description: This project implements a Python-based inventory management system that allows users to manage product data stored in a product.txt file. The system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for adding, updating, deleting, and searching for products. Additionally, a bubble sort algorithm is integrated to sort products based on their price. The project also includes an analysis of the bubble sort's complexity under different data conditions.

Key Features:
Add Products: Users can add new products to the inventory by specifying product details such as name, description, and price.
Update Products: Users can update existing product details, including changing the price or description.
Delete Products: Users can remove products from the inventory.
Search Products: Users can search for products based on name or other attributes.
Sorting: The product list can be sorted by price using the bubble sort algorithm.
Complexity Analysis: The project includes an analysis of the bubble sort algorithm's performance and its time complexity under various data conditions (e.g., sorted, reverse-sorted, and random data).

Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used for implementing the inventory management system and the bubble sort algorithm.
File Handling: Product data is stored in a product.txt file, and the system reads from and writes to this file.
Bubble Sort Algorithm: Used for sorting products by price and analyzing sorting complexity.
